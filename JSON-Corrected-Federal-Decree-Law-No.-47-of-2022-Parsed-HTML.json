Corporate Tax under this Article if held directly by the Taxable\n              Person, subject to any conditions that may be prescribed under\n              paragraph (e) of this Clause.Any other

legislation;the Taxable Person has recognised a deductible impairment loss in\n              respect of the Participating Interest prior to the Participating\n              Interest meeting the

impairment loss in respect of a loan receivable from the\n              Participation.Where the impairment loss referred to in paragraph (c) of Clause 6 of\n          this Article isreversed in a subsequent Tax Period, the associated income of the\n          Taxable Person shall be exempt from Corporate Tax in that Tax Period\n          up to the amount of income from the Participating Interest that was\n          not exempted under paragraph (c) of Clause 6 of this Article.The exemption under this Article does not apply to a loss realised on\n          the liquidation of a Participation.The exemption under this Article shall not apply for a period of (2)\n          two years where a Participation was acquired in exchange for the\n          transfer of an ownership interest that did not meet the conditions of\n          Clause 2 of this Article or a transfer that was exempted under Article\n          26 or 27 of this Decree-Law.Where a Taxable Person fails to hold a 5% (five percent) or greater\n          ownership interest in the Participation for an uninterrupted period of\n          at least (12) twelve months, any income previously not taken into\n          account under this Article shall be included in the calculation of the\n          Taxable Income in the Tax Period in which the ownership interest in\n          the Participation falls below 5% (five percent).The Minister may prescribe that an ownership interest in the shares or\n          capital of a juridical person meets the minimum ownership requirement\n          under Clause 2 of this Article where the acquisition cost of that\n          ownership interest exceeds a threshold specified by the Minister.Article 24 – Foreign Permanent Establishment ExemptionA Resident Person can make

Article applies, a Resident Person shall not\n          take into account the following in determining its Taxable Income or\n          Corporate Tax Payable for a Tax Period:losses in any of its

associated expenditure in any of its Foreign\n              Permanent Establishments, calculated as if the relevant Foreign\n              Permanent Establishments were a Resident Person under this\n              Decree-Law; andany Foreign Tax Credit that would have been available under\n              Article 47 of this Decree-Law had the election under Clause 1 of\n              this Article not been made.For the purposes of this Article, “income and associated expenditure”\n          of a Taxable Person's Foreign Permanent Establishments for a Tax\n          Period is the aggregate of the income and associated expenditure in\n          each of the relevant foreign jurisdictions.In determining the income and associated expenditure of a Foreign\n          Permanent Establishment, a Resident Person and each of its Foreign\n          Permanent Establishments shall be treated as separate and independent\n          Persons.For the purposes of Clause 4 of this Article, a transfer of assets or\n          liabilities between a Resident Person and its Foreign Permanent\n          Establishment shall be treated as having taken place at Market Value\n          at the date of the transfer for the purposes of determining the\n          Taxable Income of that Resident Person.The exemption under Clause 1 of this Article shall apply to all\n          Foreign Permanent Establishments of the Resident Person that meet the\n          condition specified in Clause 7 of this Article.The exemption under Clause 1 of this Article shall only apply to a\n          Foreign

be subject to tax that is of a\n          similar character to Corporate Tax, under the applicable legislation\n          of the country or territory in which the Non-Resident Person is\n          resident.Chapter 8 – Reliefs Article 26 – Transfers Within a Qualifying GroupNo gain or loss needs to be taken into account in determining the\n          Taxable Income in relation to the transfer of one or more assets or\n          liabilities between two Taxable Persons that are members of the same\n          Qualifying Group.Two Taxable Persons shall be treated as members of the same Qualifying\n          Group where all of the following conditions are met:The Taxable Persons are juridical persons that are Resident\n              Persons, or Non- Resident Persons that have a

shall be treated as being transferred at\n              its net book value at the time of transfer so that neither a gain\n              nor a loss arises; andthe value of any consideration paid or received against the\n              transfer of the asset or liability shall equal the net book value\n              of the transferred asset or liability.The provision of Clause 1 of this Article shall not apply where,\n          within (2) two years from the date of the transfer, any of the\n          following occurs:There is a subsequent transfer of the asset or liability outside\n              of the Qualifying Group.The Taxable Persons cease to be members of the same Qualifying\n              Group.Where Clause 4 of this Article applies, the transfer of the asset or\n

relevant Tax Period.Article 27 – Business Restructuring ReliefNo gain or loss needs to be taken into account in determining Taxable\n          Income in any of the following circumstances:A Taxable Person transfers its entire Business or an independent\n              part of its Business to another Person who is a Taxable Person or\n              will become a Taxable Person as a result of the

            another Person who is a Taxable Person or will become a Taxable\n              Person as a result of the transfer in exchange for shares or other\n              ownership interests of the

economic reality.For the purposes of this Decree-Law, where a Taxable Person applies\n          Clause 1 of this Article, all of the following must be observed:The assets and liabilities transferred shall be treated as being\n              transferred at their net book value at the time of transfer so\n              that neither a gain nor a loss arises.The value of the shares or ownership interests received under\n              paragraph (a) of Clause 1 of this Article shall not exceed the net\n              book value of the assets transferred and liabilities assumed, less\n              the value of any other form of consideration received.The value of the shares or ownership interests received under\n              paragraph (b) of Clause 1 of this Article shall not exceed the\n

Person who is a partner in an Unincorporated Partnership that is\n              treated as a Taxable Person under Clause 9 of Article 16 of this\n              Decree-Law.Where a Taxable Person transfers an independent part of its Business,\n          paragraph (d) of Clause 3 of this Article shall apply only to those\n          unutilised Tax Losses that can be reasonably attributed to

Length PrincipleIn determining Taxable Income, transactions and arrangements between\n          Related Parties must meet the arm's length standard as specified in\n          Clauses 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this Article and any conditions that may be\n          prescribed in a decision issued by the Authority.A transaction or arrangement between Related Parties meets the arm's\n          length standard if the results of the transaction or arrangement are\n          consistent with the results that would have been realised if Persons\n          who were not Related Parties had engaged in a similar transaction or\n          arrangement under similar circumstances.The arm's length result of a transaction or arrangement between\n          Related Parties must be determined by applying one or a combination of\n          the following transfer pricing methods:The comparable uncontrolled price method.The resale price method.The cost-plus method.The transactional net margin method.The transactional profit split method.The Taxable Person may apply any transfer pricing method other than\n          the methods listedin Clause 3 of this Article where the Taxable Person can demonstrate\n          that none of the above methods can be reasonably applied to determine\n          an arm's length result and that any such other transfer pricing method\n          used satisfies the condition of Clause 2 of this Article.The choice and application of a transfer pricing method or combination\n          of transfer pricing methods under Clause 3 or 4 of this Article must\n          be made having regard to the most reliable transfer pricing method and\n          taking into account following factors:The contractual terms of the transaction or arrangement.The characteristics of the transaction or arrangement.The economic circumstances in which the transaction or arrangement\n              is conducted.The functions performed, assets employed, and risks assumed by the\n              Related Parties entering into the transaction or arrangement.The business strategies employed by the Related Parties entering\n              into the transaction or arrangement.The Authority's examination as to whether income and expenditures\n          resulting from the Taxable Person's relevant transactions or\n          arrangements meet the arm's length standard shall be based on the\n          transfer pricing method used by the Taxable Person in accordance with\n          Clause 3 or 4 of this Article, provided such transfer pricing method\n          is appropriate having regard to the factors mentioned in Clause 5 of\n          this Article.Application of the selected transfer pricing method or combination of\n          transfer pricing methods in accordance with Clause 3 or 4 of this\n          Article may result in an arm's length range of financial results or\n          indicators acceptable for establishing the arm's length result of a\n          transaction or arrangement between Related Parties, subject to any\n          conditions specified in a decision issued by the Authority.Where the result of the transaction or arrangement between Related\n          Parties does not fall within the arm's length range, the Authority\n          shall adjust the Taxable Income to achieve the arm's length result\n          that best reflects the facts and circumstances of the transaction or\n          arrangement.Where the Authority makes an adjustment to the Taxable Income pursuant\n          to Clause 8 of this Article, the Authority shall rely on information\n          that can or will be made available to the Taxable Person.Where the Authority or a Taxable Person adjusts the Taxable Income for\n          a transaction orarrangement to meet the arm's length standard, the Authority shall\n          make a corresponding adjustment to the Taxable Income of the Related\n          Party that is party to the relevant transaction or arrangement.Where a foreign competent authority makes an adjustment to a\n          transaction or arrangement involving a Taxable Person to meet the\n          arm's length standard, such Taxable Person can make an application to\n          the Authority to make a corresponding adjustment to its Taxable\n          Income.Article 35 – Related Parties and ControlFor the purposes of this

provided by a Taxable Person to its Connected\n          Person shall be deductible only if and to the extent the payment or\n          benefit corresponds with the Market Value of the service, benefit or\n          otherwise provided by the Connected Person and is incurred wholly and\n          exclusively for the purposes of the Taxable Person's Business.For the purposes of this

Article, by using the TaxablePerson's available Foreign Tax Credit as determined under Article 47\n          of this Decree-Law.To the extent there is a residual amount after Clause 2 of this\n

met:The principal objective and activity of the Participation is the\n              acquisition and holding of shares or equitable interests that meet\n              the conditions of Clause 2 of this Article.The income of the Participation derived during the relevant Tax\n              Period or Tax Periods substantially consists of income from\n              Participating Interests.A

Clause 3 of Article 11 of this Decree- Law.Gains or losses on the transfer, sale, or other disposition of a\n              Participating Interest (or part thereof) derived after expiry of\n

insofar as:the Participation can claim a deduction for the dividend or other\n              distributions made to the Taxable Person under the applicable tax\n              legislation;the Taxable Person has recognised a deductible impairment loss in\n              respect of the Participating Interest prior to the Participating\n              Interest meeting the conditions of Clause 2 of this Article;the Taxable Person or its Related Party who is subject to\n              Corporate Tax under this Decree-Law has recognised a deductible\n              impairment loss in respect of a loan receivable from the\n              Participation.Where the impairment loss referred to in paragraph (c) of Clause 6 of\n          this Article isreversed in a subsequent Tax Period, the associated income of the\n          Taxable Person shall be exempt from Corporate Tax in that Tax Period\n          up to the amount of income from the Participating Interest that was\n          not exempted under paragraph (c) of Clause 6 of this Article.The exemption under this Article does not apply to a loss realised on\n          the liquidation of a Participation.The exemption under this Article shall not apply for a period of (2)\n          two years where a Participation was acquired in exchange for the\n          transfer of an ownership interest that did not meet the conditions of\n          Clause 2 of this Article or a transfer that was exempted under Article\n          26 or 27 of this Decree-Law.Where a Taxable Person fails to hold a 5% (five percent) or greater\n          ownership interest in the Participation for an uninterrupted period of\n          at least (12) twelve months, any income previously not taken into\n          account under this Article shall be included in the calculation of the\n          Taxable Income in the Tax Period in which the ownership interest in\n          the Participation falls below 5% (five percent).The Minister may prescribe that an ownership interest in the shares or\n          capital of a juridical person meets the minimum ownership requirement\n          under Clause 2 of this Article where the acquisition cost of that\n          ownership interest exceeds a threshold specified by the Minister.",
